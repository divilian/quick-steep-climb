\chapter{Applications}

I was going to make this chapter the finale of the book, but found I just
couldn't wait. This is what I love about linear algebra: not the abstract
manipulation of meaningless numbers in grids, but the ways in which the whole
topic of matrices applies beautifully and usefully to real-world scenarios.

This chapter doesn't begin to cover \textit{all} the applications of linear
algebra! Those are vast, and probably innumerable. But here are a few of my
favorites presented in capsule form so you can get a taste for why it's useful
to do all this stuff.
