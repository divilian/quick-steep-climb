\chapter{Eigenapplications}

We end this book with a few more ultra-cool real-world applications of linear
algebra. Unlike those in Chapter~\ref{ch:apps}, though, these will all involve
the \textbf{eigenvalue} concepts you learned in Chapter~\ref{ch:eigen}. Our
new ability to penetrate to the heart of a matrix and understand its inner
structure will enable us to do things we could only dream about before.
