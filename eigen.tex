\chapter{Eigenanalysis}
\label{ch:eigen}

The title of this chapter alone is enough to make one's blood run cold. You
might be thinking, ``even if I could pronounce this, would I want to?''

In German, the root \textit{eigen} (pronounced EYE-gun) means something like
``one's own, inherent thing.'' As we'll see, in studying the eigenvectors and
eigenvalues of a matrix -- which is called eigen-analysis -- we're examining
its deepest, innermost properties. We're peering deep within all the flesh to
see its skeleton. And it turns out this is the key to the most profound
understanding of what a given matrix is and does.

Just look at all the nifty words we'll learn:

\begin{compactitem}
\item \textbf{eigenvector}
\item \textbf{eigenvalue}
\item \textbf{eigendecomposition}
\item \textbf{eigenbasis}
\end{compactitem}

These are all involved in the \textbf{eigenanalysis} of a matrix.

\section{The resonant frequency}

\index{resonant frequency}
\index{frequency, resonant}

We could come at this subject in a bunch of different ways, but let me start
with the first thing that clicked for me when I learned it. At the time, I was
reminded of the phenomenon of a ``resonant frequency'' that some systems
exhibit.

\index{playground}
\index{swing}

You'll remember this effect if you've ever been on a playground swing. When
somebody pushes you (or when you pump your legs to ``push'' yourself) you have
to do it at the right time and at the right pace. The swing has a natural
frequency of oscillation, and it resists being pushed faster or slower than
that. If you find you're swinging from back to front every two seconds, you'll
have to pump your legs every two seconds. Period. Even if you have thighs like
Dwayne Johnson, trying to pump once every 1.5 seconds --  or even furiously at
5 times a second -- will do you no good. Timing it so you pump your legs at
exactly the swing's resonant frequency is the only way to go higher and higher.

\index{Tacoma Narrows Bridge}
\index{bridge}
\index{Slinky}

There are other famous examples of the resonant frequency phenomenon. Perhaps
you've heard of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge (if you've never seen it, check out
the video on
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zczJXSxnw}{\underline{YouTube}}). It
was a beautiful double-lane suspension bridge in Washington State that crossed
the Puget Sound -- at the time, the third-largest suspension bridge in the
world. Incredibly, on November 7th, 1940, it began to wobble with increasing
intensity as crosswinds dangerously amplified its internal structural
vibrations. It looked like a 3,000-foot-long undulating Slinky.\footnote{The
classic ``Slinky'' toy, by the way, is another example of a system that has a
resonant frequency. You can't make it go down the stairs any faster or slower
than it wants to go.} Moments later, the concrete cracked and split and the
entire bridge completely collapsed and fell into the water. Luckily, drivers
had wisely stopped crossing it minutes before, and the only actual casualty was
a cocker spaniel.

The reasons for the Tacoma Bridge catastrophe are a bit complex, but a key
contributing factor was that a very specific rate of oscillation -- a ``sweet
spot,'' though it was hardly sweet for those involved -- caused the
fluctuations to build on each other instead of being dampened. It's as if the
Tacoma Bridge \textit{wanted} to vibrate at a certain frequency, just like a
playground swing has an intrinsic rhythm that the child can't speed up or slow
down.

\index{guitar}
\index{piano}
\index{middle C}

Yet another example: every non-percussive musical instrument. A piano or guitar
string tuned to middle~C has a certain length and tension, which causes it to
resist vibrations at any frequency other than exactly 262 per second. Thus,
when you strike it, only the 262~Hz\footnote{``Hz,'' pronounced ``hertz,'' is a
unit meaning ``cycles (backs-and-forths) per second.'' Every musical note is
defined by a particular frequency. The lowest key on the piano is 27.5~Hz, and
the highest is 4,186~Hz.} tone gains any traction, and the instrument sounds a
clear, pure note.

\section{Linear operators, revisited}

\index{linear operator}

Okay, so what does all this have to do with linear algebra? Well, consider the
linear operators we learned about in Section~\ref{linearOps}
(p.~\pageref{linearOps}). Remember that a linear operator is a square matrix
that transforms one vector into another one of the same dimension when you
left-multiply that vector by the matrix. Let's look at this one:

\begin{align*}
\renewcommand*{\arraystretch}{1.4}
M =
\begin{bmatrix} 
1\frac{1}{2} & -1 \\
\smallskip
-\frac{1}{2} & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix},
\end{align*}

and take it for a spin. If we multiply it by, say, {\footnotesize $\begin{bmatrix} 1
\\ 2 \end{bmatrix}$}, we get:

\begin{align*}
\renewcommand*{\arraystretch}{1.4}
\small
\begin{bmatrix} 
1\frac{1}{2} & -1 \\
\smallskip
-\frac{1}{2} & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix} \cdot
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\ 2 \\
\end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix}
-\frac{1}{2} \\ 1\frac{1}{2} \\
\end{bmatrix}, \normalsize \quad \textrm{so}\ 
\boldmath
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\ 2 \\
\end{bmatrix} \rightarrow \textrm{\textbf{\footnotesize maps to}} \rightarrow
\begin{bmatrix}
-\frac{1}{2} \\ 1\frac{1}{2} \\
\end{bmatrix}.
\unboldmath
\end{align*}

For the input {\footnotesize $\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$}, we get:

\vspace{-.2in}
\begin{align*}
\renewcommand*{\arraystretch}{1.4}
\small
\begin{bmatrix} 
1\frac{1}{2} & -1 \\
\smallskip
-\frac{1}{2} & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix} \cdot
\begin{bmatrix}
2 \\ 1 \\
\end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix}
2 \\ 0 \\
\end{bmatrix}, \normalsize \quad \textrm{so}\ 
\boldmath
\begin{bmatrix}
2 \\ 1 \\
\end{bmatrix} \rightarrow
\begin{bmatrix}
2 \\ 0 \\
\end{bmatrix}.
\unboldmath
\end{align*}

And $M$ maps the input {\footnotesize $\begin{bmatrix} -3 \\ 5 \end{bmatrix}$} to:

\vspace{-.2in}
\begin{align*}
\renewcommand*{\arraystretch}{1.4}
\small
\begin{bmatrix} 
1\frac{1}{2} & -1 \\
\smallskip
-\frac{1}{2} & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix} \cdot
\begin{bmatrix}
-3 \\ 5 \\
\end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix}
-9\frac{1}{2} \\ 6\frac{1}{2} \\
\end{bmatrix}, \normalsize \quad \textrm{so}\ 
\boldmath
\begin{bmatrix}
-3 \\ 5 \\
\end{bmatrix} \rightarrow
\begin{bmatrix}
-9\frac{1}{2} \\ 6\frac{1}{2} \\
\end{bmatrix}.
\unboldmath
\end{align*}

See a pattern? Me neither. It seems to be all over the place, mapping each
input to some random output with no real rhyme or reason. All of these mappings
are depicted in Figure~\ref{nonEigenvec} (p.~\pageref{nonEigenvec}).

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{crazytrans1.png} \quad
\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{crazytrans2.png} \\

\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{crazytrans3.png}
\caption{The $M$ matrix's operation. Three randomly-chosen input vectors
(solid) are mapped to crazy output vectors (dashed).}
\label{nonEigenvec}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Hitting a matrix's resonant frequency}

None of that was very special. Random-looking stuff gets mapped to other
random-looking stuff. But now here comes the plot twist. Let's strike this bad
boy at its \textit{resonant frequency}.

% [ 1 1 ], [ -2 1 ]

\vspace{-.2in}
\begin{align*}
\renewcommand*{\arraystretch}{1.4}
\small
\begin{bmatrix} 
1\frac{1}{2} & -1 \\
\smallskip
-\frac{1}{2} & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix} \cdot
\begin{bmatrix}
-1 \\ \frac{1}{2} \\
\end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix}
-2 \\ 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}, \normalsize \quad \textrm{so}\ 
\boldmath
\begin{bmatrix}
-1 \\ \frac{1}{2} \\
\end{bmatrix} \rightarrow
\begin{bmatrix}
-2 \\ 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}.
\unboldmath
\end{align*}

It's easy to miss the significance of that, so if nothing jumped out at you,
look again. What we just discovered is that the vector {\footnotesize
$\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ \frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}$} is sort of magic: if we feed
it as input to $M$, the output is \textit{a scaled version of the same vector}.
In fact, it exactly doubled in size.

\smallskip

Let's try that again, with the {\footnotesize $\begin{bmatrix} -2 \\ 1
\end{bmatrix}$} we just got back:

\vspace{-.2in}
\begin{align*}
\renewcommand*{\arraystretch}{1.4}
\small
\begin{bmatrix} 
1\frac{1}{2} & -1 \\
\smallskip
-\frac{1}{2} & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix} \cdot
\begin{bmatrix}
-2 \\ 1 \\
\end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix}
-4 \\ 2 \\
\end{bmatrix}, \normalsize \quad \textrm{so}\ 
\boldmath
\begin{bmatrix}
-2 \\ 1 \\
\end{bmatrix} \rightarrow
\begin{bmatrix}
-4 \\ 2 \\
\end{bmatrix}.
\unboldmath
\end{align*}

Boom. It exactly doubled again. And if we then feed it {\footnotesize
$\begin{bmatrix} -4 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix}$}:

\vspace{-.2in}
\begin{align*}
\renewcommand*{\arraystretch}{1.4}
\small
\begin{bmatrix} 
1\frac{1}{2} & -1 \\
\smallskip
-\frac{1}{2} & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix} \cdot
\begin{bmatrix}
-4 \\ 2 \\
\end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix}
-8 \\ 4 \\
\end{bmatrix}, \normalsize \quad \textrm{so}\ 
\boldmath
\begin{bmatrix}
-4 \\ 2 \\
\end{bmatrix} \rightarrow
\begin{bmatrix}
-8 \\ 4 \\
\end{bmatrix}.
\unboldmath
\end{align*}

\index{piano}
\index{middle C}

Boom. It exactly doubled again. This is very intriguing. Vectors in this one
particular direction aren't ``jumping around'' like the other ones did when $M$
acted on them. Instead, the matrix just plays them back for us (at twice the
volume) like a pure middle C singing out from a piano. Figure~\ref{eigenvec1}
(p.~\pageref{eigenvec1}) shows the illustration.
